abstract = {Frequency optimization is of great importance in the design of machines and structures subjected to dynamic loading. When the natural frequencies of considered structures are maximized using the solid isotropic material with penalization (SIMP) model, artificial localized modes may occur in areas where elements are assigned with lower density values. In this paper, a modified SIMP model is developed to effectively avoid the artificial modes. Based on this model, a new bi-directional evolutionary structural optimization (BESO) method combining with rigorous optimality criteria is developed for topology frequency optimization problems. Numerical results show that the proposed BESO method is efficient, and convergent solid-void or bi-material optimal solutions can be achieved for a variety of frequency optimization problems of continuum structures.}

abstract = {Finding optimized structural topology design for maximizing natural frequencies and frequency gaps of continuum structures is crucial for engineering applications. However, two significant numerical issues must be addressed: non-smoothness caused by multiple frequencies and Artificial Localized Rigid Motion (ALRM) modes due to the violation of the topological constraint related to isolated islands and point-connections. The above two issues are solved by employing the discrete variable topology optimization method based on Sequential Approximate Integer Programming (SAIP).}

This can be achieved by, e.g., maximizing the fundamental eigenfrequency, an eigenfrequency of higher order, or the gap between two consecutive eigenfrequencies of given order. This problem is often complicated by the fact that the eigenfrequencies in question may be multiple, and this is particularly the case in topology optimization. In the present paper, different approaches are considered and discussed for topology optimization involving simple and multiple eigenfrequencies of linearly elastic structures without damping.}
