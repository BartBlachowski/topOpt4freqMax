## How to read the table

Count/time columns represent method-native computational stages and are not mathematically identical across methods. Total wall time is the common performance quantity.

Du-Olhoff reconstruction (Pedersen stiffness + linear mass, adaptive box): Count 1 = outer iterations, Count 2 = cumulative nested MMA iterations, Time 1 = outer work excluding the nested MMA solve, Time 2 = nested MMA total. The two counts are never added.

## Du-Olhoff reconstruction (Pedersen stiffness + linear mass, adaptive box)

The Olhoff column is labelled "Du-Olhoff reconstruction (Pedersen stiffness + linear mass, adaptive box)" and must not be labelled "Olhoff 2007". It is produced by analysis/OlhoffCurrent at the named preset duOlhoffPedersenAdaptiveBoxSensitivityFiltered (upstream preset duOlhoffAdaptivePedersen @ 2530692). It is NOT the historical SIMP + eq. (4b) realization that earlier campaigns labelled "Du-Olhoff reconstruction (M4)" (preset duOlhoffSimpEq4bBetaStallLadderSensitivityFiltered): the two differ in the low-density material law and the outer controller.

> Du-Olhoff RECONSTRUCTION, Pedersen/adaptive-box formulation (class C controller and filter radius, class B/D material law): SIMP p = 3 with the Pedersen (2000) linearized low-density stiffness (rho*rho0^(p-1) below rho0 = 0.1) and LINEAR mass, eq. (2); a per-element ADAPTIVE move box (initial 0.10, floor 0.002, x1.2 on monotone / x0.7 on reversing outer steps); NATURAL termination by ||drho||_2 < 0.05*sqrt(NE/3200) with no guards and no persistence, a heuristic design-change stop and not a KKT certificate; Sigmund sensitivity filter on all f_sk at a FIXED PHYSICAL radius R = 0.06 (1.2 elements at 160x20, 6 at 800x100). This is a DISTINCT formulation from the historical SIMP + eq. (4b) OlhoffCurrent reconstruction (duOlhoffSimpEq4bBetaStallLadderSensitivityFiltered), not a bug fix of it; Pedersen stiffness is the alternative Du & Olhoff sec. 2.2 name, not their choice. Terminal bimodality is NOT expected beyond coarse meshes: in the committed R = 0.06 sweep the optimum is bimodal only at 160x20 (native gap12 0.7 %) and native gap12 is 11.8-24.5 % from 240x30 to 800x100. Native eigenfrequencies are those of the Pedersen/linear-mass model; any cross-method table must name its evaluator model. Must NOT be labelled "Olhoff 2007". Field-level provenance (A/B/C/D) is documented in analysis/OlhoffCurrent/+impl/architecture/docs/SCIENTIFIC_CONFIG_PROVENANCE.md and is printed per run by olh.config.describe.

The outer iteration count of the Du-Olhoff reconstruction is set by its per-element adaptive move box and its mesh-scaled design-change tolerance, neither of which the original publication specifies, and it is NOT monotone in the mesh (committed R = 0.06 sweep: 121, 111, 101, 93, 112, 130, 156, 204, 246 outer iterations from 160x20 to 800x100). Per-outer-iteration cost is therefore reported next to total wall time.

### Cost per outer iteration

Total wall time and per-outer-iteration cost, from the same per-iteration timers. eig/outer includes FE assembly.

| Mesh | Outer | Total [s] | Total/outer [s] | Outer excl. inner/outer [s] | eig/outer [s] | Inner/outer [s] | Inner MMA/outer | Per inner it. [s] | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 160x20 | 3 | 1.633 | 0.5445 | 0.0369 | 0.0323 | 0.4907 | 19.33 | 0.0254 | CAP_HIT |

## Memory

Reliable, method-independent peak-memory measurement was not available in the MATLAB environment; memory was omitted rather than reported with inconsistent semantics.

## Scaling

Scaling exponents may be fitted only to complete campaign data and never to smoke or preflight runs. For the Du-Olhoff reconstruction the outer iteration count is a property of the reconstruction's controller and stop, not of the published method, and need not be monotone in the mesh; a total-time exponent mixes per-iteration cost with that count, so the per-outer-iteration cost fit is reported alongside it. Either exponent describes this reconstruction, not the published method.

_No scaling fit was performed for this run: this run is not a complete performance campaign; a scaling exponent must not be fitted to smoke or preflight data_
