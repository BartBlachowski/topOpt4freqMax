\# Topology optimization for frequency maximization



This repository contains code for three diffrent approaches to topology optimization for frequency maximization. All of them are based on SIMP method, but differ in selected way for fundamental frequency maximization.



The first approach uses classical double-loop approach probposed by Du and Olhoff (2007). The second one uses two level static approximation proposed by Yuksal and Yilmaz (2025). Finally, the third approach is newly proposed one-level quasi-static approachimation.
